# macros-jam-code

Exercises used in the Macros hands-on at LambdaJam 2013 in Brisbane, Australia and CUFP 2013 in Boston, USA.

Slides of the workshop can be found on [slide share](http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/clojure-macros-workshop-lambdajam-2013-cufp-2013).

## Usage

Run midje from the terminal:

`lein midje`

or

`lein midje :autotest`

And all facts should be failing. Your task is to fix them by writing and/or fixing existing macros

You can refer to CHEATSHEET.md in the root directory for tips on the various macro syntax bits.
